    <h2>Ian</h2>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Ian. I'm a returned missionary and I served in the Texas San Antonio Mission. This is my first year at BYU-Idaho and I'm excited to be here! The photo above is of me at the DC temple from my recent trip to visit my grandparents who live in Delaware.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in going into game developement and working in with computers. I'm taking this class to explore my interests and see what I might like to persue as a career. I grew up in Utah, but was born in Honalulu Hawaii.I'm the oldest of four siblings with two sisters and a brother.</p>
    <p>A few of my hobbies include watching movies, playing survival video games, working out, biking, drawing, and photography. I look forward to learnig with all the other students in this class and developing my own skills as a web developer.</p>
